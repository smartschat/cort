# cort v03

This branch contains a version of __cort__ with more models and a better train/dev/test workflow. Due to missing documentation the code cannot replace the main version of __cort__. However, the scripts in the main directory can be used to replicate the results from my PhD thesis (Martschat, 2017). If you have any questions, please write me a mail.
